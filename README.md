# Java Web Crawler with MongoDB Integration

A Java web crawler is a program that systematically browses web pages and extracts data. In this example, we will create a web crawler that targets the "https://ecomotive.ir/" website and saves the extracted data to a MongoDB database.

## Steps

1. Set up the required dependencies:
   - Java development environment.
   - MongoDB database with appropriate credentials.

2. Configure the MongoDB connection parameters in the Java program.

3. Use a Java library like JSoup or HttpClient to perform HTTP requests and extract data from web pages.

4. Implement the web crawling logic, including the following steps:
   - Start from the initial URL ("https://ecomotive.ir/").
   - Send an HTTP GET request to the URL and retrieve the HTML response.
   - Parse the HTML response to extract the desired data using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.
   - Save the extracted data to the MongoDB database.

5. Implement crawling depth control to limit the number of pages visited or to restrict the crawl to a specific depth.

6. Handle exceptions and errors gracefully, such as network errors or malformed HTML.

7. Run the Java program to initiate the web crawling process.

8. Verify that the extracted data is being saved to the MongoDB database correctly.

## Benefits of Using MongoDB

- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for storing large amounts of web data.
- It offers a JSON-like document model, allowing you to store and query structured or semi-structured data efficiently.
- MongoDB's flexible schema allows easy adaptation to changing data structures during the crawling process.

By following these steps and integrating MongoDB into your Java web crawler, you can effectively crawl the "https://ecomotive.ir/" website and store the extracted data in a MongoDB database for further analysis or processing.

Remember to customize the code and configurations to fit your specific requirements, such as defining the data structure to be stored in MongoDB or adjusting the web crawling logic based on the target website's structure.
